# Metadata Demo



## Licensing
This application as configured, requires a license for DotImage Photo Pro or  DotImage Document Imaging. Optionally the WinDemoHelperMethods class will include additional codecs such as PDF. PDF support will automaticlly enable if you have a license for our PdfReader addon.


## SDK Dependencies
This app was built based on 2026.2.0.0. It targets .NET Framework 4.6.2 and was created in Visual Studio 2022. However, it's fairly backward compatible as distributed. If you start adding references, you can run into issues if you're using an especially outdated version of DotImage. It should also open and run equally well in Visual Studio 2026 without undue modification.  


### Using NuGet for SDK Dependencies
We do publish our SDK components to NuGet. We have chosen to base the demo on local installed SDK because this leads to much smaller applications (NuGet packages add a lot of overhead due to the way they're packaged and deployed, and many of our demos -- including this one -- are often used to reproduce issues that need to be submitted to support. Apps that use NuGet are often significantly larger and run up against our maximum support case upload size)

Still, if you wish to use NuGet for the dependencies instead of relying on locally installed SDK, you can.

## Cloning
We recommend the following to ensure you clone with the required submodule

Example: git for windows
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AtalaSupport/DemoGallery_Desktop_MetadataDemo_CS_x64.git MetadataDemo
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

If you've got DotImage 2026.2 installed and licensed, it should just build and run.
